# Lab: Building a web application on Azure Platform-as-a-Service offerings
# Student lab manual

## Lab scenario

You are the owner of a startup organization and have been building an image gallery application for people to share great images of food. To get your product to market as quickly as possible, you decided to use Microsoft Azure App Service to host your web applications and APIs. Recently, you realized that the images that are being uploaded to your application are simply too large. Out of concern for storage and bandwidth costs, you decided to use Azure Functions to process images in the background and shrink them down to thumbnails that can be loaded quickly.

## Objectives

After you complete this lab, you will be able to:

  - Create various apps by using the Azure App Service.

  - Configure application settings for an app.

  - Deploy apps by using Kudu, the Azure CLI, and zip deployment.

  - Author a function app to process Azure Storage images.

## Lab setup

  - Estimated time: 90 minutes

## Instructions

### Before you start

#### Sign in to the lab virtual machine

  - Ensure that you are signed in to your **Windows 10** virtual machine by using the following credentials:
    
      - **Username**: Admin
    
      - **Password**: Pa55w.rd

#### Review installed applications

  - Observe the taskbar located at the bottom of your **Windows 10** desktop. The taskbar contains the icons for the applications that you will use in this lab:
    
      - Microsoft Edge
    
      - File Explorer
    
      - Windows PowerShell
    
      - Visual Studio Code

#### Download the lab files

1.  On the taskbar, select the **Windows PowerShell** icon.

2.  In the PowerShell command prompt, change the current working directory to the **Allfiles (F):\\** path:

    ```
    cd F:
    ```

3.  Within the command prompt, enter the following command and press Enter to Clone the **microsoftlearning/AZ-203-DevelopingSolutionsForAzure** project hosted on GitHub into the **Labfiles** directory:

    ```
    git clone --depth 1 --no-checkout https://github.com/microsoftlearning/AZ-203-DevelopingSolutionsForMicrosoftAzure .
    ```

4.  Within the command prompt, enter the following command and press **Enter** to check out the lab files necessary to complete the **AZ-203.02** lab:

    ```
    git checkout master -- Allfiles/*
    ```

5.  Close the currently running **Windows PowerShell** command prompt application.

### Exercise 1: Build a back-end API by using Azure Storage and API Apps

2.  Access the **Access Keys** blade of your newly created **storage account** instance.

3.  Record the value of the **Connection string** field. You will use this value later in this lab.

#### Task 3: Upload a sample blob

1.  Access the **imgstor\*** storage account that you created earlier in this lab.

4.  Create another new **container** with the following settings:
    
      - **Name**: images-thumbnails
    
      - **Public access level**: Blob (anonymous read access for blobs only)

5.  Navigate to the new **images** container.

6.  Use the **Upload** button to upload the **grilledcheese.jpg** file located in the **Allfiles (F):\\Labfiles\\02\\Starter\\Images** folder on your lab machine.

> **Note**: It is recommended that you enable the **Overwrite if files already exist** option.

#### Task 4: Create an API app

  - Create a new **API app** with the following details:
    
      - **App name**: imgapi*\[your name in lowercase\]*
    
      - **Existing** **resource** **group**: ManagedPlatform

6.  Find the **apps** that have the prefix **imgapi\***:

<!-- end list -->

    az webapp list --resource-group ManagedPlatform --query "[?starts_with(name, 'imgapi')]"

7.  Print only the name of the single app that has the prefix **imgapi\***:

<!-- end list -->

    az webapp list --resource-group ManagedPlatform --query "[?starts_with(name, 'imgapi')].{Name:name}" --output tsv

8.  Change the current directory to the **Allfiles (F):\\Labfiles\\02\\Starter\\API** directory that contains the lab files:

<!-- end list -->

    cd F:\Labfiles\02\Starter\API\

9.  Deploy the **api.zip** file to the **API app** you created earlier in this lab:

    az webapp deployment source config-zip --resource-group ManagedPlatform --src api.zip --name <name-of-your-api-app>

> > **Note**: Replace the **\<name-of-your-api-app\>** placeholder with the name of the API app that you created earlier in this lab. You recently queried this app’s name in the previous steps.

10. Access the **imgapi\*** *API app* you created earlier in this lab.

11. Open the **imgapi\*** *API app* in your browser.

12. Perform a **GET** request to the root of the website and observe the JSON array that is returned. This array should contain the URL for your single uploaded image in your **Azure Storage** account.

#### Review

In this exercise, you created an API App in Azure and then deployed your ASP.NET Core web application to the API App by using the Azure CLI and Kudu’s zip deployment utility.

### Exercise 2: Build a front-end web application by using Azure web apps

9.  Back in the **View files** tab, select the **function.json** file to view the editor for the function’s configuration.

10. In the JSON editor, observe the current configuration:

<!-- end list -->

    {
      "bindings": [
        {
          "name": "myBlob",
          "type": "blobTrigger",
          "direction": "in",
          "path": "images/{name}",
          "connection": "AzureWebJobsStorage"
        }
      ],
      "disabled": false
    }

11. Replace the entire contents of the JSON configuration file with the following JSON content:

<!-- end list -->

    {
      "bindings": [
        {
          "name": "inputBlob",
          "type": "blobTrigger",
          "direction": "in",
          "path": "images/{name}",
          "connection": "AzureWebJobsStorage"
        },
        {
          "type": "blob",
          "name": "outputBlob",
          "path": "images-thumbnails/{name}",
          "connection": "AzureWebJobsStorage",

    }

12. In the JSON editor, select **Save** button to persist your changes to the configuration.

13. Back in the **View files** tab, select the **run.csx** file to return to the editor for the **ImageManager** function.

14. Minimize the **View files** tab.

> > **Note**: You can minimize the tab by selecting the arrow immediately to the right of the tab header.

15. In the function editor, observe the example function script:

<!-- end list -->

    public static void Run(Stream myBlob, string name, ILogger log)
    {
        log.LogInformation($"C# Blob trigger function Processed blob\n Name:{name} \n Size: {myBlob.Length} Bytes");
    }

16. **Delete** all the example code.

17. Within the editor, copy and paste the following placeholder function:

<!-- end list -->

    using SixLabors.ImageSharp;
    using SixLabors.ImageSharp.PixelFormats;
    using SixLabors.ImageSharp.Processing;
    using SixLabors.ImageSharp.Formats.Jpeg;
    using SixLabors.Primitives;
    
    public static void Run(Stream inputBlob, Stream outputBlob, string name, ILogger log)
    {
    }

18. In the editor, select **Save** to save the script and compile the code.

19. Add the following line of code to log information about the function execution:

<!-- end list -->

    log.LogInformation($"C# Blob trigger function Processed blob\n Name:{name} \n Size: {inputBlob.Length} Bytes");

20. Add the following **using** block to load the **Stream** for the input blob into the image library:

<!-- end list -->

    using (Image<Rgba32> image = Image.Load(inputBlob))
    {
    }

21. Add the following lines of code within the **using** block to mutate the image by resizing the image and applying a grayscale filter:

<!-- end list -->

    image.Mutate(i => 	
        i.Resize(new ResizeOptions { Size = new Size(250, 250), Mode = ResizeMode.Max }).Grayscale()
    );

22. Add the following line of code to save the new image to the **Stream** for the output blob:

<!-- end list -->

    image.Save(outputBlob, new JpegEncoder());

23. Your **Run** method should now resemble the following:

<!-- end list -->

    using SixLabors.ImageSharp;
    using SixLabors.ImageSharp.PixelFormats;
    using SixLabors.ImageSharp.Processing;
    using SixLabors.ImageSharp.Formats.Jpeg;
    using SixLabors.Primitives;
    
    public static void Run(Stream inputBlob, Stream outputBlob, string name, ILogger log)
    {
        log.LogInformation($"C# Blob trigger function Processed blob\n Name:{name} \n Size: {inputBlob.Length} Bytes");
        using (Image<Rgba32> image = Image.Load(inputBlob))
        {
            image.Mutate(i => 	
                i.Resize(new ResizeOptions { Size = new Size(250, 250), Mode = ResizeMode.Max }).Grayscale()
            );
            image.Save(outputBlob, new JpegEncoder());
        }
    }

24. In the editor, select **Save** to save the script and compile the code again.
